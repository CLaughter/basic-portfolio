        <p>
          In the past, I have worked with some self-taught coding, but it was not congruent. So I chose to take on a Web Development Coding Boot Camp. I'm liking the structured approach.

        <p>
          I'm from Walnut, CA and now reside in the SLC, UT area. 
        
          Some hobbies I enjoy are guitar, riding my bike and fishing.
          
          Being an integral part of a dynamic and flourishing team to develop robust and secure web applications is what I am pursuing.
          
          I enjoy being able to work on a project utilizing marketable skills I have obtained and realizing the good results therein.
